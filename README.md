## 93 % Promotion Accuracy. (Promotion Prediction Robot for Companies).

Creating a machine learning model that predicts outcomes is not easily accepted, especially if it has an immediate influence on a person's well-being.

Emotions are not programmable. That is something that all bots lack. However, before deployment, bots are often trained, tested, retrained, and retested until they fulfill our expectations; but even so, humans must still intervene at some point.

This is a one-of-a-kind bot that uses logistic regression to predict whether or not employees will be promoted based on their performance and other factors.

Logistic Regression is a problem solution for binary classification. It can categorize decisions as either negative or good (1 or 0). Depending on your request, 1 (one) might signify either positive or negative.

Should a bot truly be employed, especially when it comes to staff increment, promotion, layoff, or demote? 

Kindly check the Github for the Bot thatâ€™s able to have 93% prediction accuracy.
